            Here are a couple of simple tools I've made for church things.<br>
            - <a href="http://pray.longlined.com">pray.longlined.com </a> creates a prayer wall that you and your small group can use. Most groups I've been in had used a google doc; this provides you a simple link and an easy way to update.<br>
            - <a href="http://prep.longlined.com">prep.longlined.com</a> is a quick copy/paste tool for Scripture. I find that it saves me quit a bit of time when looking for cross-references or preparing any type of lesson.

            These are the slides to a couple of Sunday School lessons I taught to the high school group at my church. They only work on a browser:<br>
            - <a href="/sundayschool/mark1">Mark 1</a><br>
            - <a href="/sundayschool/mark4">Mark 4</a><br>
            </p>

            A little bit about myself: I enjoy breakfast.
